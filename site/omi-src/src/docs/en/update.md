## Update

`update` method is an important built-in core method for updating components themselves. For example:

```js
this.update()
```

You can also pass parameters to decide whether to ignore attributes in html mode and updates:

```js
this.update(true)
```

For example, click on the mask of the pop-up layer to close the pop-up, pass it to the parent component in the react, let the parent component update, while Omi advocates self-update, so that the diff area is smaller.

```js
onMaskClick = ()=> {
  //change props
  this.props.show = false
  //prevent parent component from updating diff without results
  this.prevProps.show = false
  //update self and ignore attributes in html mode
  this.update(true)
  //trigger events, which can be used to change external state variables to maintain consistency, but external components need not be updated
  this.fire('close')
}
```

### UpdateSelf

`updateSelf` method does not update child components.
